## Consideration

> Benefit (gain) / detriment (loss) theory



### Types of consideration

> * Executory - promisee has not yet completed the consideration requirements
>
>   > Lana and Phillip enter into an agreement for the sale and purchase of goods which are to be delivered and paid for at a later date
>
> * Executed -  consideration is provided at the time the contract is made or before
>
>   > Executed consideration is part of the deal, agreement or exchange and hence valid
>   >
>   > Teri offers to pay Kiji 1500v if Kiji brings his boat to the wharf and takes Teri and his supplies out to his island.
>
> * Past
>
>   > If one party voluntarily performs an act, and the other party then makes a promise, the consideration for the promise is said to be in the past. The rule is that past consideration is no consideration, so it is not valid and cannot be used to sue on a contract. In these situations, the promise by the promisor must be regarded as a mere expression of gratitude for past favours or as a designated gift, and no contract will arise.
>   >
>   > For example, A gives B a lift home in his car. On arrival B promises to give A £5 towards the petrol. A cannot enforce this promise as his consideration, giving B a lift, is past.

>   * *Re McArdle*
>
>     > Majorie McArdle carried out certain improvements and repairs on a bungalow. The bungalow formed part of the estate of her husband's father who had died leaving the property to his wife for life and then on trust for Majorie's husband and his four siblings. After the work had been carried out the brothers and sisters signed a document stating in consideration of you carrying out the repairs we agree that the executors pay you £480 from the proceeds of sale. However, the payment was never made.
>     >
>     > Held:
>     >
>     > The promise to make payment came after the consideration had been performed therefore the promise to make payment was not binding. Past consideration is not valid.
>
>   * Re Casey's Patents
>
>     > ### Facts
>     >
>     > - The claimant promoted the defendant’s patents
>     > - After most of the work was completed, the defendant promised to pay. He subsequently didn’t pay
>     >
>     > ### Issue
>     >
>     > - Could the past consideration make the promise to pay binding
>     >
>     > ### Decision
>     >
>     > - Yes, claim succeeded
>     >
>     > ### Reasoning
>     >
>     > - As there was an understanding of remuneration `報酬`, there was an obligation to pay; the consideration was sufficient
>     >
>     >   ​
>     >
>     > Thus, the rule that emerges from *Re Casey’s Patents*, and which is applied in *Pao On v Lau Yiu Long*, is that if:
>     >
>     > > (i)                 there is a request for services;
>     > >
>     > > (ii)                which is carried out; and
>     > >
>     > > (iii)               both parties have held the expectation that there would be payment for the services
>     >
>     > then, a later promise by the requestor to provide payment is enforceable as the consideration provided was executed consideration not past consideration. 
>     >
>     > Under this analysis, a contract comes into existence at the time the requestee performs the action.  Hence, it is a unilateral contract `单方面合同`.  The contract is not void for uncertainty, even though the payment price is not set at the time the contract is formed, because the courts will infer a reasonable price for the services, unless this is clearly against the intention of the parties.  The later promise by the requestor if not rejected by the requestee is the setting by the parties of this reasonable price.



### Rules of consideration

> * must be legal
>
> * must come from the promisee (e.g. *Beswick v Beswick*) 
>
>   > Major exceptions:
>   >
>   > * The Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act
>   > * Assignment and novation
>   > * Agency
>
> * must be sufficient, need not be adequate
>
>   > ### Facts
>   >
>   > - A husband wished for his wife to inherit his house
>   > - The executors of the husband’s will agreed that thw wife could have possession of the house in return for the wife paying £1 per year ground rent
>   > - The executors refused to go through with the agreement
>   >
>   > ### Issue
>   >
>   > - Does consideration (£1) have to be sufficient
>   >
>   > ### Decision
>   >
>   > - No, claim allowed
>   >
>   > ### Reasoning
>   >
>   > - Consideration must be present, but it need not be sufficient. It for parties to ensure that they get themselves a good bargain.



### Problem of duties being sufficient

> * Sufficient of legal duties
>
> * Sufficiency of contractual duties
>
>   * *Stilk v Myrick* (existing contractual obligation)
>   * *Hartley v Posenby* (> contractual obligation)
>
> * Payment of lesser sums
>
>   * Sufficiency of "lesser sum" (*re Pinnel*)
>
>     > The claimant was owed £8 10 shillings. The defendant paid £5 2 shillings and 2p. The claimant sued for the amount outstanding.
>     >
>     > Held:
>     >
>     > The claimant was entitled to the full amount even if they agreed to accept less. Part payment of a debt is not valid consideration for a promise to forebear the balance unless at the promisor's request part payment is made either:
>     >
>     > a). before the due date or
>     > b). with a chattel or
>     > c). to a different destination
>
>   * *Foakes v Beer*
>
>     > Dr Foakes owed Mrs Beer £2,000 after she had obtained judgment against him in an earlier case. Dr Foakes offered to pay £500 immediately and the rest by instalments, Mrs Beer agreed to this and agreed she would not seek enforcement of the payment provided he kept up the instalments. No mention was made in this agreement of interest although judgment debts generally incurred interest. Dr Foakes paid all the instalments as agreed and Mrs Beer then brought an action for the interest.
>     >
>     > Held:
>     >
>     > Dr Foakes was liable to pay the interest. The agreement reached amounted to part payment of a debt and under the rule in Pinnel's case this was not good consideration for a promise not to enforce the full amount due.

### Promissory estoppel

> A promise is enforceable by law, even if made without formal consideration, when a promisor has made a promise to a promisee who then relies on that promise to his subsequent detriment `損害`.
>
> Central London Property v High Trees (no new contract: LL no benefit, T has benefit)
>
> > High Trees leased a block of flats from CLP at a ground rent of £2,500. It was a new block of flats at the time the lease was taken out in 1937. The defendant had difficulty in getting tenants for all the flats and the ground rent left High Trees with no profit. In 1940 many of the flats were still unoccupied and with the conditions of the war prevailing, it did not look as if there was to be any change to this situation in the near future. CLP agreed to reduce the rent to £1,250 during the war years. The agreement was put in writing and High Trees paid the reduced rent from 1941. When the war was over the flats became fully occupied and the claimant sought to return to the originally agreed rent.
> >
> > Held:
> >
> > The rent would be returned to the originally agreed price for the future only. CLP could not claim back the arrears accrued during the war years. This case is important as Denning J (as he then was) established the doctrine of promissory estoppel. Promissory estoppel prevented CLP going back on their promise to accept a lower rent despite the fact that the promise was unsupported by consideration.
