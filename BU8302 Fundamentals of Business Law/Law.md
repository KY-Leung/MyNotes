Two major sources of law in Singapore

## Law

### Legislation Law `立法`

> Statutes or acts passed by Parliament and subsidiary legislation made by various administrative bodies pursuant to powers given by the statutes (e.g. Penal Code, Bankruptcy Act, Employment Act, Copyright Act) 

### Case Law / Common Law `判例法/普通法`

> More discretion because is the judge who "writes" the case
>
> *Doctrine of Precedent*: once a case has been decided, generally future cases that are the same will be bound by the earlier decision provided that the earlier decision was made by a higher court in the same hierarchy.
>
> Ensure consistency and predictability
>
> Countries: USA, Commonwealth countries `英聯邦國家`

### Civil Law `民事法`

> All law is codified by Parliament
>
> Not much room for judges to make law and *Doctrine of Precedent* is not well-established
>
> Countries: France, Germany, Vietnam, Indonesia, China, Japan

Singapore, being a British colony, received its laws from Britain. Cases decided in England are still referred to by local courts in areas where the laws are the same or similar.



## Proceedings

### Criminal Proceedings `刑事訴訟`

> Concerned with forbidding certain kinds of wrongful conduct and punishing those who perpetrate it.
>
> Matters which harm the society or which are against public interest or safety are made criminal, pursuant to various statutes such as the Penal Code.
>
> E.g. Murder, rape, theft
>
> Breaches of the the Employment Act and the Workplace Safety and Health Act are criminal actions brought against businesses.

### Civil Proceedings `民事訴訟`

## Litigation `訴訟`

> Having a trial `審訊` in a court of law

>
> Beside litigation, there are alternatives to resolve civil disputes such as negotiation.
