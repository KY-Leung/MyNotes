>     > A husband worked overseas and agreed to send maintenance payments to his wife. At the time of the agreement the couple were happily married. The relationship later soured and the husband stopped making the payments. The wife sought to enforce the agreement.

>     > The agreement was a purely social and domestic agreement and therefore it was presumed that the parties did not intend to be legally bound.

>     > A Grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger entered into a weekly competition run by the Sunday Empire News. The coupon was sent in the Grandmothers name each week and all three made forecasts and they took it in turns to pay. They had agreed that if any of them won they would share the winnings between them. The grandmother received £250 in prize money and refused to share it with the other two. The lodger brought the action to claim one third of the prize money.

>     > There was a binding contract despite the family connection as the lodger was also party to the contract. This rebutted the presumption of no intention to create legal relations.

>     > The claimant was an airline pilot working for the defendant. He was to be made redundant. The defendants said that if he withdrew his contributions to the company pension fund, they would pay him the equivalent of company contributions in an ex gratia payment `特惠款項`. The claimant agreed to this and withdrew his contributions. The company then ran into further financial difficulty and went back on their promise relating to the *ex gratia* payment.

>     > Held:
>     >
>     > The agreement had been made in a business context which raised a strong presumption that the agreement is legally binding. The claimant could therefore enforce the agreement and was entitled to the money.

>   - Rose v Frank Cromption
>
>     > The claimants and defendants entered an agreement for the supply of some carbonised tissue paper. Under the agreement the claimants were to be the defendant's sole agents in the US until March 1920. The contract contained an honourable pledge clause which stated the agreement was not a formal or legal agreement and shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in neither England nor the US. The defendants terminated the agreement early and the claimants brought an action for breach.

>     > Held:
>     >
>     > The honourable pledge clause rebutted `反駁` the presumption which normally exists in commercial agreements that the parties intend to be legally bound by their agreements. The agreement therefore had no legal affect and was not enforceable by the courts.

>     > Malaysia Mining Corporation Metals Ltd (MMC Metals) was a wholly owned subsidiary of the defendant, MMC BHD. MMC Metals approached the claimant KB Bank for a loan. MMC Metals was a relatively newly formed company lacking in the size and resources of MMC BHD. The bank approached MMC BHD asking if they would act as guarantor for the loan. MMC refused to act as guarantor but stated they it was their company policy to ensure that their subsidiaries are always in a position to meet their debts. In reliance of this letter of comfort the bank advanced money to MMC Metals. MMC Metals subsequently went into administration having not paid the loan. KB brought an action against MMC BHD to recover their loss based on the assurance given in the comfort letter.

>     > The comfort letter had no legal effect. The fact that MMC BHD had refused to act as guarantor demonstrated they did not intend to be legally bound. The comfort letter referred to company policy at that time. There was nothing to stop the company changing its policy.
