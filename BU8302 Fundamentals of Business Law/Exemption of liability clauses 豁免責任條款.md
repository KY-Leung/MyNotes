Discuss why you think that the Unfair Contract Terms Act (“UCTA”) is effective in ensuring consumer protection by making it difficult for exemption of liability clauses `免责条款` to be valid. You should limit your discussion only to the provisions `規定` of UCTA that apply to exemption of liability clauses and any case law directly applicable to the respective provisions.



## Exemption of liability clauses `豁免責任條款`

### Effect

* Important when there is a breach `違約`
* Helps to avoid or limit liability

### Problem of validity `合法性`

* Consent not sufficient
* Must comply with requirements

### Public policy conflict

* A man must do what he promised
* A man is bound by what he agrees
* A man must be liable for his actions and/or inactions

### 3 Steps

1. Must be part of the contract (Pg, 65 - 66)

   > * Brought to notice before or at time of contract
   >
   >   * Is there reasonable notice of the clause?
   >
   >     > * Visibility  (but once signed, bounded)
   >     > * Place where it is found: reasonably expect to find contractual terms
   >     > * Indirect reference: refer to another place
   >     > * Language: illiterate didn't affect the validity
   >
   > * Effect of past dealings
   >
   > * Effect of oral representations
   >
   > * Effect of not reading

2. The words must cover the breach

   > Scope of the clause must compass the breach 條款的範圍必須指明違規行為
   >
   > * Ambiguous words: strictly construed against the party who is trying to reply on it (e.g. load == human?)
   > * words clearly cover the breach

3. Must comply with UCTA

### Any other unusual factors

* Availability of insurance
* Ability to prevent or cover the breach

### Exclude or limit liability for a fundamental breach

If the contract intended the exclusion clause to cover such fundamental breaches, valid, else invalid.



## UCTA `不正當合同條款法`

> Death or personal injuries cased by negligence of party in breach
>
> Doesn't regulate all types of unfair terms
>
> Statute primarily deals only with exclusion or limitation clauses

### Reasonableness of clause

* Bargaining position
* Brought to attention
* Special consideration
* Pre-condition must reasonably convenient to comply
* Special made to order



Clauses that try to exclude

> Clause states that the party in breach is not liable at all, in respect pf certain events

Limit liability

> Clause states that the party in breach is liable only to a limited extent in respect of certain events

Used as a defense for breach of contract



### Factors to prove if a clause is reasonable

* The bargaining strength of the parties
  * Both commercial organizations -> Equal bargaining strengths -> Could have negotiated the terms -> Reasonable
* Whether the customer received an inducement to agree to the term
  * Pay more Cover more
* Whether the customer knows or ought to know about the exemption clause
  * Reasonable if the clause is common / used often in the trade / parties had a previous course of dealings using such clauses
* Compliance with some condition
  * Liable if satisfy certain condition
* Insurance
  * More practicable for the photo shop to take out insurance to cover potential liabilities as compared to the custome
