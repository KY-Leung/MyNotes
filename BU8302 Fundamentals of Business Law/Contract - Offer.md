# Contract

> An agreement enforceable by law.
>
> A contact must satisfy the following in order to be enforceable in law:
>
> * there must be an offer
> * there must be acceptance of that offer
> * there must be consideration / it must be a document under seal or deed
> * there must be an intention to create legal relations
>
> *If any element is missing, there will not be a valid contract



# Offer

> An intimation of willingness by an offeror to enter into a legally binding contract.
>
> Its terms either expressly or impliedly indicate that it is to be binding on the offeror if offeree accepted
>
> An offer may be made to a single person, a group of persons or the whole world.
>
> E.g. A says to B, "Would you like to buy this bike from me for $20?"
>
> OR B says to A, "Will you sell me your bike for $20?"

## *Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (Pg. 24)*

> The company had made an offer to the whole world and that the offer had been accepted by Mrs Carlill



# Invitation to treat

> An offer to negotiate / an offer to receive offers
>
> Not an indication by the offeror to bound if other party interested in proceeding further.
>
> E.g. X rings up a company and make some general inquiries about the product

## Example

### Display of goods

*Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemicals (Pg. 25)*

> Customer made the offer when he went to the cashier. The sale or contract was made when the cashier accepted the customer's offer.
>
> Mistake in price, cashier refuse his offer and quote a new price. If accepted, there is a contract at the new price.
>
> If considered as an offer:
>
> * seller may not be able to reserve goods or has already sold
> * customer tries, put into the basket or when he brings to the cashier, customer has accepted and unable to change his mind.

### Advertisements

*Partridge v Crittenden (Pg. 25)*

*Workspace Consultants Pte Ltd v Teo Seng Siew (Pg. 25)*

> Advertc isements, catalogues & menus are Invitation to treat.
>
> Because it would be unreasonable to expect the advertiser to always have sufficient stocks unless he states so or it appears otherwise. Hence, the advertiser will not be liable for breach of contract,

> Customer makes an offer. Business doesn't have to accept if no stocks. Hence no contract.

*Harris v Nickerson (Pg. 26)* 

> Advertiser withdrew auction, not liable as there was no contract

#### Advertisements may amount to offer

Unilateral contracts `單邊合同`

> Only 1 party make a promise, the other party doesn't promise anything
>
> E.g. Rewards for dog found, if found, finder can enforce X's promise. 

*Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Co (Pg. 24)*

*3 empty cans = free gift*

### Company prospectus `公司招股`

> The company is not promising that all applications will definitely be approved or granted. Potential investors would be making an offer.

### Auctions

> Invitation to treat = Auction calls for bids
>
> Offer = Bidder places a bid
>
> Acceptance & contract formed = Select highest bid & knocks hammer

### Tenders `招標`

> Invitation to treat = Calls for the tender
>
> Offer = Tender is placed
>
> Not obliged to accept if lowest / highest, unless expressly binds to accept (E.g. *Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust Co of Canada Ltd*)

### Quotations

> Depends on factors like what the quotation actually states and whether essential matters have been addressed.
>
> *Scancarriers v Aoeteroa International Ltd (Pg. 28)*
>
> > Matters not fixed, hence the quotations was not an offer



# Termination of offer

> Once terminated, the offer would be incapable of acceptance

## Revocation `廢止`

> By the offeror before acceptance.
>
> To be effective, it has to be communicated to the offeree
>
> E.g. *Byrne v Van Tienhoven (Pg. 28)*: accepted offer before receiving the revoke letter, hence a binding offer
>
> E.g. *Dickinson v Dodds (Pg. 28)*: Hand over formal acceptance despite knowing house was sold, hence offer was withdrawn and could not be accepted
>
> Though offeror stated that the offer would be open till a certain time, he would not be bound to keep the offer open and can revoke anytime

> 2 offers:
>
> * to sell the house
> * to keep that earlier offer open for a stated period of time
>   * Offerer hasn't given consideration (e.g money) and hence contract wouldn't be enforceable
>   * E.g. Buyer giving a sum of money for Seller to keep the offer open for a period of time

## Lapse of Time `時間流逝`

> Accept after promised date / reasonable amount of time, no contract
>
> E.g. *Ramsgate Victoria Hotel Co v Montefiore (Pg. 30)s*ubject to 

## Offer subject to condition 

> Offer employment to X provided X passes a medical examination

## Death

> Offeror dies and offeree has notice of this, the offer cannot be accepted
>
> Offeror dies and offeree has NO notice of this:
>
> * Contract of personal service, incapable of acceptance
> * Non-personal contract, capable of acceptance (to-be-fulfilled by others)
>
> Offeree dies, unlikely someone else can accept

## Rejection

> Once offeree rejects, cannot subsequently accepting it
>
> If offeree makes a counter-offer, that counter-offer has the effect of rejecting the original offer
>
> E.g. *Hyde v Wrench*, not bound to sell as the counter-offer destroyed the original offer
>
> If offeree is just asking more info regarding the original offer and is clear that he is not rejecting, the original offer is still capable of acceptance
