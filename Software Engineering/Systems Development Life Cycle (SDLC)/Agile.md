# [Agile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9QbYZh1YXY&t=3s)

* a set of values and principles
* making each decision based on the principles and values that the team has decided to follow
* gives people a common foundation for making decisions about the best way to develop software
* a collection of beliefs that teams can use for making decisions about how to the work about developing SW
* doesn’t make decision for you, it gives you a foundation that team can use for making decision for better SW development

> builds software incrementally from the start of the project, instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.
>
> breaking projects down into little bits of user functionality called user stories, prioritizing them, and then continuously delivering them in short two week cycles called iterations.

#### How does a team become agile? 

> They make decisions based on Agile values and principles and come out with practices. 
>
> The decision making process is how the team becomes agile.
>
> The values and principles give enough flexibility for the team to develop SW best for their situation.



## Agile Manifesto

* Individuals & Interactions > Processes & tools
* Working SW > Comprehensive documentations
* Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation
* Responding to change > Following a plan



## 12 Principles (giving the ability to make a good decision)

* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable SW 
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage
* Deliver working SW frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
* Working SW is the primary measure of progress
* Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant paceindefinitely
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
* Simplicity – the art of maximizing the amount of work not done – is essential
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly



#### How to get requirement from business owners

Before:

> Business owners write down all requirement and sign off before beginning to work

After:

> Against 
>
> * Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation
> * Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project



#### Implementing a feature for business owner, needs the DB to make the feature works

Before:

> Stop working on the feature and build a robust DB that will handle the need of the feature and provide support for later development

After:

> If building up this DB, it will delay what the customer can see as a valuable SW that they can use.
>
> If I can find a way just to build what is necessary for this feature, it will better align with the principles



# Scrum

> often used to manage complex software and product development, using iterative and incremental practices.
>
> enable organizations to adjust smoothly to rapidly-changing requirements, and produce a product that meets evolving business goals

1. A product owner creates a prioritized wish list called a product backlog.
2. During sprint planning, the team creates a sprint backlog by pulling a small chunk from the product backlog, and decides how to implement those pieces.
3. The team has a certain amount of time — a sprint (usually two to four weeks) — to complete its work
4. The team meets each day to assess its progress (daily Scrum).
5. Along the way, the ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on its goal.
6. At the end of the sprint, the work should be potentially shippable: ready to hand to a customer, put on a store shelf, or show to a stakeholder.
7. The sprint ends with a sprint review and retrospective.
8. As the next sprint begins, the team chooses another chunk of the product backlog and begins working again.



# JIRA (Dashboard)

* getting visibility into their work
* collaborating to complete work
* See issues: New features, task, improvement, epic, story



#### For Scrum

* Review past performance in each sprint 
* Backlog:
  * select stories that deliver must value to the customer @ the end of the sprint
  * collaborate& gain mature understanding & estimate the stories
  * Identify the sprint commitment and identify the sprint
* Board (in each sprint)
  * To do, In progress, In review, To deploy, Done
  * Traceability to every commit
* Burndown chart (*work left to do versus time*)
  * What got done & what didn't
