# About ReST

#### 1. What is ReST

> * stands for Representational State Transfer
> * an architecture style for designing networked applications
> * relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol
> * in virtually all cases, HTTP protocol is used to make calls between machines
> * REST uses HTTP for CRUD
>   * Create = POST
>   * Read = GET
>   * Update = PUT
>   * Delete = DELETE



#### 2. What is ReST API

> * a set of functions to perform requests and receive responses via HTTP protocol such as GET and POST
> * use HTTP, can be used by practically any programming language and easy to test



#### 3. How an API can be considered “RESTful”

> has the following features:
>
> 1. **Client–server** – The client handles the front end the server handles the backend and can both be replaced independently of each other.
> 2. **Stateless** – No client data is stored on the server between requests and session state is stored on the client.
> 3. **Cacheable** – Clients can cache response (just like browsers caching static elements of a web page) to improve performance.



#### 4. Response formats for ReST API

> * REST
> * XML-RPC
> * SOAP

# About HTTP

#### 1. What is HTTP

> * protocol which uses HTTP on a connection encrypted by [transport-layer security](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/t/tls.htm)
> * a set of standards that allow users of the World Wide Web to exchange information found on web pages
> * When accessing any web page entering http:// tells the browser to communicate over HTTP
> * Now default method of communication
> * used to protect transmitted data from eavesdropping `窃听`
> * protect a website's users from censorship `审查` by a government or an ISP
> * uses **port 443** to transfer its information



#### 2. Common HTTP status codes

> enable a client accessing another computer or device over HTTP to know how to proceed or not proceed

## [Passing data](https://medium.com/@thejasonfile/callback-functions-in-react-e822ebede766)

Information in React gets passed around to components in two different ways. 

### `props`

> from parent to child

### Callback function

> Child component get information back to its parent
>
> Instead of passing down a piece of the state to a child component, the parent can pass down a callback function.
>
> This callback function is run at a later time, usually through some interaction with the child component. The purpose of this callback function is to change a piece of the state that is a part of the parent component. This closes the data loop.
